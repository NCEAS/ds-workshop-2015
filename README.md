## The Event

We will convene to discuss community training needs, shared goals, existing resources (including products from previous workshops), and opportunities for coordination among training efforts, with the goal of producing 1) a manuscript for peer-reviewed publication that provides direction for training in data-intensive environmental research, and 2) a prospectus for new collaborations among training initiatives.

## Workshop topics

- Summarize existing workshop results and initiatives
	- ISEES Workforce development
	- Lessons learned from OSS/DC/SC/University courses
	- Lists of existing curricula (workshops, grad courses, etc.), map
- Examine differing approaches to training (e.g., science vs tools, â€¦)
	- CS versus domain science curricula/courses
		- What opportunities exist for collaboration between e.g., CS/ecology?
		- SC/DC/OSS versus applied modeling/applied stats/programming courses
- Generate vision for integrated training in data-intensive science

## Agenda

### September 9, 2015

- 8am Coffee
- 8:30 am: 
	- Welcome and introductions (plenary) - Jones
		- Background and summary of survey responses - Jones
			- Set stage for manuscript and products
		- Brainstorming 1: What are the critical gaps in data-intensive science training?
		- Brainstorming 2: What is needed to span these critical gaps?
			- Organize and prioritize into potential breakouts
- 10:15 am: Break
- 10:30 am
	- Parallel Breakouts (Goal: Produce section/figure/blurb for paper)
		- B1: Mapping the spectrum of training initiatives
			- What do they cover? What are pre-reqs for each? How can they be sequenced? Further populate survey.
			- Gap analysis: What is missing from existing trainings?
			- Coordination: what is needed to connect and improve training?
		- B2: Building a catalog of data-intensive training lessons/curricula
			- Design and evaluation of catalog / usability / features
			- Initial assembly of catalog; enumerate subject areas and learning goals
			- Design of open contribution system to continue to build catalog
			- What topics are missing curricula (see ISEES list)
		- B3: TBD from brainstorming session

- 12 noon Lunch
- 1:30 pm
	- Report back from breakouts
- 2:00 pm (inlcudes break)
	- Breakouts  (Product: section/figure/blurb for paper) (Parallel breakouts)
		- B4: Discussion: what does success look like in training?
			- Assessment: common metrics, basis for network of training programs
			- RCN vs NRT
		- B5: Training program coordination
		- B6: Training sustainability
- Adjourn 5pm

### September 10, 2015

- 8am Coffee
- 8:30 am 
	- Discussion: Career pathways, culture of engineering in science
		- Is engineering a valid training goal in science programs?

- 10:15 am Break
- 10:30 am 
	- Discussion: manuscript outline and plans
- 12 noon Lunch
- 1:30 pm
	- Collaborative proposals (breakouts?)
		- What resources are needed/missing/underfunded?
		- What opportunities exist for improving training?
		- Where do we get the instructors? How far can the Software Carpentry model go?
	- 3:00 pm Break
	- 3:30 pm
		- Manuscript consoldation and discussion
	- 4:45 pm
		- Conclusion and wrapup
- Adjourn 5pm
