# Skills for environmental science

The following table originated from the ISEES Workforce Development workshops.  See the [ISEES Strategic Plan](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1320917) for details.

Table 1: Knowledge and skills needed in the workforce, in order to advance environmental science through data-enabled research approaches and to create software that is sustainable within this field.
 
|Basic | Intermediate | Advanced |
|------|--------------|----------|
data documentation | version control | intellectual property
command line programming | data enabled science  | scalability of computation
how to cite software | data archiving | model interoperability
directories and files | basic command line programming | numerical analysis
units and dimensional analysis | data structures | parallelization - code, hardware
how to archive data | diversity of algorithms | numerical stability
computational literacy | uncertainty, analysis/model assumptions / error | verification (code)
visual literacy | spatial analysis | cloud computing
units and dimension analysis | exploratory data analysis | object-oriented design
data wrangling – handling diverse “messy” data | issue tracking | code that interacts with the web
inter-disciplinary thinking | open science | algorithms - code for big data (attached to scalability)
data-enabled science skills | standards and tools | interoperability (package API)
collaboration skills | knowledge of public repositories | unit testing
fundamental computing architecture | workflows | advanced metadata
conceptual modeling | semantics, ontologies, and taxonomies, vocabularies | high performance computing
pseudocode | software life cycle | software licensing for coders
data management best practices |   | hardware knowledge
